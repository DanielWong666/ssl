Using Git and GitHub

- Git is a version control system that allows developers to 
track changes made to their codebase over time
- Git is the gateway to GitHub, an online platform
- You are gonna use Git and GitHub forever

Actions
  - Install Git in your computer
  - Cteate an account on GitHub (use your main email, add a picture, try 
  to pick a short username and/or a name that makes sense, save your 
  credentials somewhere)
  - Treat your GitHub as an extension of your LinkedIn (you need a job!)

Using GitHub
  - Cteate a repo on GitHub (remote repository)
  - Create a repo in your file system (local repository)
    - a folder for a project
    - Initiate a new repo
  - Connect them using the url provided by GitHub

Basic commands
  - Go to your project folder
  - Right-click on it and open it on Integrated terminal
  - Run 'git status' to see if that is already a git repository
  - If not, run 'git init'. Now you have a local repo
  - Copy, paste and run the 'remote' url on your local repo. That is the bridge
    between your local work and the remote work

   Local (your pc)<------------------->Remote (GitHub)
  - Once you have new files/folders, you have to add, commit and push to GitHub.
   'commit' basically means to create a 'save point' in your project history
   - add .
   - commit -m 'A meaningful message'
   - push -u origin main
