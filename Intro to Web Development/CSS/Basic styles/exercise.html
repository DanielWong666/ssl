                Victor Hedman has had some time to digest a seismic summer 
                for the Tampa Bay Lightning.

                That doesn't make seeing his former teammate — a friend he 
                sat beside on the plane and shared road meals with for 15 NHL 
                seasons — sporting yellow threads any less strange.

                Steven Stamkos signed with the Nashville Predators in 
                unrestricted free agency on July 1 after the now-former 
                Lightning captain was unable to agree on a deal with the 
                club that drafted him first overall in 2008.

                eventually seemed inevitable as the clock ticked towards 
                the market's opening, his departure was still jarring for 
                Hedman once made official.
