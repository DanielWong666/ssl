Important




- 90% of time you will be making silly, easy-fixed mistakes
-
- Do not use a language other than English

- Your code must be organized, well-formatted and easy to read
- It's not HTML's job to style anything

- File structure
  -project
    - index.HTML
    - about.HTML
    - assets or src 
      - css or style
      - js or script
      - img

- The main html file is always index.html 
- File names are always in lowercase
- Keep things simple and consistant (dont reinvent the wheel)
- Dont use <br> and &nbsp, Spaces and margins are controlled by css
- Only 1 <h1> per page is recommended
- Form means validation. Validation means dont trust users
- Avoid using !important in your styles
- Clors are not random. 
- Borders and shadows must be smooth and subtle. Sometimes, they are almost 
  invisible
- Containers usally contain content, not the section background.
- For background, prefer using 'jpg' instead of 'png'. Make sure the image has 
   an appropriate dimension/size(1440*900) and it is light (<300kb)
- We always need to provide a sans-serif font. Most of the time, our pages 
   need only one font, with different weights.
- Always respect the language's naming convention
