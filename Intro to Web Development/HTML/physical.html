          <strong>Ontario</strong> child-care centres that aren’t 
          participating in the national $10-a-day
          <span style="background-color: red;">program will 
          soon</span> lose provincial funding to offer fee subsidies 
          to <em>lower-income families and their staff</em> could 
          see a <kbd>pay cut of $2 an hour.</kbd>
        </p>
        <p>
          In a memo <sup>sent to licensed</sup> operators in Ontario outlining
          changes <sub>to how the province</sub> is funding the $10-a-day 
          program, an <small>assistant deputy minister</small> of education 
          wrote <samp>that starting</samp> in 2025, non-participating 
          centres <mark style="background-color: blueviolet;">will no 
          longer</mark> receive routine
          funding <pre>such as</pre> “general operating, fee subsidy or wage 
          enhancement grants.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <cite>Families who already</cite> get fee subsidies for child 
          care will continue to <big>benefit</big> until their 
          child ages out or leaves their
          provider, <s>the memo said,</s>but any new families won’t be 
          able to access subsidies for kids aged five and under in 
          centres outside the <code>$10-a-day system.</code>
