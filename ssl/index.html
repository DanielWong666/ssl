          <h2>What is SSL?</h2>
          <p>
            SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an encryption-based Internet 
            security protocol. It was first developed by Netscape in 1995 
            for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data 
            integrity in Internet communications. 
          </p>
          <h2>What is TLS?</h2>
          <p>
            TLS stand for Transport Layer Security, it is a widely adopted 
            security protocol designed to facilitate privacy and data security 
            for communications over the Internet. A primary use case of TLS is 
            encrypting the communication between web applications and servers, 
            such as web browsers loading a website. TLS can also be used to 
            encrypt other communications such as email, messaging, and 
            voice over IP (VoIP). 
          </p>
          <h2>How can I tell that my webpage is secure?</h2>
          <p>
            A secure website's URL should begin with “https” rather than “http”.
            The “s” at the end of “http” stands for secure and is using an 
            SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection. Your information will be 
            encrypted before being sent to a server.
          </p>
          <h2>What does it mean to be secure?</h2>
          <p>
            Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting internet-connected 
            systems such as hardware, software and data from cyberthreats. 
            It's used by individuals and enterprises to protect against 
            unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems.
          </p>
          <h2>What is encryption and why do I care?</h2>
          <p>
            Encryption is the process through which data is encoded so 
            that it remains hidden from or inaccessible to unauthorized users.
            It helps protect private information, sensitive data, and can 
            enhance the security of communication between client apps 
            and servers.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Do the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when we're talking 
            about secure websites?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Yes, they are. The “s” at the end of “http” stands for secure and 
            is using an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection. So https is 
            secure, but http is not.
          </p>
          <h2>What is an SSL certificate authority?</h2>
          <p>
            A certificate authority (CA) is a trusted entity that issues 
            Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates. These digital certificates 
            are data files used to cryptographically link an entity with a 
            public key. Web browsers use them to authenticate content sent 
            from web servers, ensuring trust in content delivered online.
